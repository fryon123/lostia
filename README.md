An SOS Call app which will send your current location to your selected persons with just one click. It uses sms as an alternative to internet to have a cheap and easy way of communication.

## Why?

Because of the geographic location of the Philippines, The country encounters an astonishing average of 20 typhoons per year. This is the cause of many casualties and injuries, and rescue operations aren't effecient as there is no way for the rescuers to pinpoint locations where stranded individuals are present. This solution was designed to enable communication between the stranded individuals and the rescuers by enabling the stranded individuals to send a location directly to the rescuers. In that situation, you want to conserve your phone battery as much as possible, so we designed this app to use SMS instead of internet to reduce the power consumption.

This solution is broad enough to be used in different situations. Ideally, this situations are when you need to let someone know your exact location immedietly, like kidnapping, accidents, and when you are left stranded. This solution will theoritically work on areas where cell signal is minimal as SMS still works under those conditions, unlike the internet.
